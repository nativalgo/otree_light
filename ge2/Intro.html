<p>
In this task, there are two types of participants: {{C.EMPLOYER_ROLE}} and {{C.EMPLOYEE_ROLE}}.
</p>
<p>
You will be randomly chosen with equal chance whether you will be an {{C.EMPLOYER_ROLE}} or an {{C.EMPLOYEE_ROLE}}. Each person selected to be an {{C.EMPLOYER_ROLE}} will be randomly paired with another person in the room who has been selected as an {{C.EMPLOYEE_ROLE}}.
</p>
<p>
The identity of the participants will remain anonymous. You will never know the identity of the person you were paired with and the other person will never know your identity.
</p>
<p>
We remind you that one task will be randomly selected for payment at the end. 1 token = {{exchange_rate_ge}}
