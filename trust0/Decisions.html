    <b> {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}}’s decision</b>
</p>
<p>
{{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}} moves first. <br>
    {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}} may send some, all, or none of the {{C.ENDOWMENT}} tokens to {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}}. <br>
    Each token sent to {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} will be tripled. <br>
    For example, if {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}} sends 2 tokens, {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} receives 6 tokens (2x3=6). If {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}} sends 8 tokens, {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} receives 24 tokens (8x3=24). <br>
    {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} will then decide how many tokens to send back to {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}} and how many tokens to keep. {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}} indicates how many tokens to send to {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} by typing the appropriate amount of tokens on the decision screen.

</p>
<p>
    <b> {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}}’s decision </b>
</p>
<p>
    {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} begins with {{C.ENDOWMENT}} tokens. In addition, {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} receives three times the amount sent by {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}}.<br>
    {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} may send back some, all, or none of the tripled amount to {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}}.<br>
    ({{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} keeps the {{C.ENDOWMENT}} tokens they started with). Any tokens sent back to {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}} will not be tripled.<br>
    Once {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}} has sent some, none, or all of their tokens, {{C.TRUSTEE_ROLE}} will then decide how many tokens to send back to {{C.TRUSTOR_ROLE}} and how many to keep.
