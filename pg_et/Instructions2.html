<p>Your decisions and earnings in every period are confidential. This means you will not be given information about the investment decisions or earnings of any of your group members, nor will they be given information about your investment decisions or earnings.
</p>
<p>
   After each period, you will receive the following information: <br>
<li>Number of tokens you invested in the private and public accounts </li>
<li>The total number of tokens invested by your group (including yours) in the public account</li>
<li>Your earnings for that period. </li>	
</p>

<p>
    You will also receive this information for the previous period during each decision round.
</p>

Once all decisions have been made for all rounds, the game will end. We will calculate payoffs based on the decisions made.
