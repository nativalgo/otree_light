    Calculation of payoffs:
</p>
<p>
    <b>Payoff of the employer = (120 - w) * e</b>
</p>
<p>
    The payoff of the employer equals: (120 - the wage paid to the employee) * the actual
effort level selected by the employee.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Payoff of the employee = w - c(e) â€“ 20</b>
</p>
<p>
The payoff of the employee equals: the wage received from the employer - the cost of the
actual effort level he selected - 20.
</p>
<p>
Thus, the higher the effort level provided by the employee and the lower the wage, the
larger the employer's payoffs. The lower the effort level provided by the employee and the
higher the wage, the larger the employee's payoffs.
</p>
<p>
Example:
If the actual wage is 50 and the actual effort level is 0.5, then the payoffs would be:<br>
Employer's payoffs = (120 - 50) * 0.5 = 35 tokens = $7.00<br>
Employee's payoffs = 50 - 6 - 20 = 24 tokens = $4.80
